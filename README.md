# fatigue-prognostics-thesis
Scripts and data used in my thesis on fatigue prognosis using COMSOL and AI
This repository supports the thesis work on synthetic and simulated fatigue data comparison and modeling.

## 📁 Scripts

- `scripts/process_comsol_100.py`: Parses and visualizes 100-cycle COMSOL output.
- `scripts/process_comsol_1000.py`: Parses and visualizes 1000-cycle simulation data.
- `scripts/process_training_data.py`: Formats and visualizes FDPP synthetic dataset.
- `scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py`: Reproduces synthetic data as in FDPP paper.

## 📂 Data

The `data/` folder contains example CSV files. Full datasets are too large and excluded.
